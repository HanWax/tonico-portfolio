# Welcome to My Blog

Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Hannah Waxman, a freelance software developer based in Tel Aviv, and I'm thrilled to finally launch this blog.

## Why Start a Blog?

After 10 years of building products at various software companies, I've accumulated a wealth of knowledge, experiences, and opinions that I've been itching to share. This blog will be my platform to:

- **Share technical insights** on software development, with a focus on AI automations
- **Document my freelancing journey** and the lessons learned along the way
- **Discuss product thinking** and how it intersects with technical decisions
- **Help other developers** navigate their careers

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

1. **AI & Automation**: Practical guides on implementing AI solutions that actually work in production
2. **Full-Stack Development**: Tips, tricks, and best practices from years of experience
3. **Freelancing**: The business side of being an independent developer
4. **Career Growth**: Mentorship insights and advice for developers at all levels

## A Bit About Me

I bring a unique perspective to software development. Beyond my technical background, I studied management at Cambridge Judge Business School, which has shaped how I approach problems—always with an eye on the business impact.

I'm also passionate about mentorship. One of my goals is to build a team that employs and develops junior developers through pair programming and hands-on guidance.

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear from you! Whether you have questions, feedback, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/hannahwaxman).

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!

Hannah
